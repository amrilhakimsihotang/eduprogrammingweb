                  ><br />"C programming language" redirects here. For the book,
                  see The C Programming Language. Not to be confused with C++ or
                  C#.<br /><br />
                  C (pronounced like the letter c) is a general-purpose computer
                  programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis
                  Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By
                  design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the
                  targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems,
                  device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly[6] for
                  application software. C is commonly used on computer
                  architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to
                  the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.
                  <br /><br />
                  A successor to the programming language B, C was originally
                  developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to
                  construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to
                  re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[7]
                  During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become
                  one of the most widely used programming languages,[8][9] with
                  C compilers available for almost[citation needed] all modern
                  computer architectures and operating systems. <br /><br />C
                  has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the
                  International Organization for Standardization (ISO). C is an
                  imperative procedural language supporting structured
                  programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a
                  static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide
                  low-level access to memory and language constructs that map
                  efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime
                  support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was
                  designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A
                  standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind
                  can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and
                  operating systems with few changes to its source code.[10]
                  Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top two
                  languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of
                  programming languages.[11]
