                  ><br />JavaScript is a bit confusing for developers
                  experienced in class-based languages (like Java or C++), as it
                  is dynamic and does not have static types. When it comes to
                  inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each
                  object has a private property which holds a link to another
                  object called its prototype. That prototype object has a
                  prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached
                  with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no
                  prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain.
                  It is possible to mutate any member of the prototype chain or
                  even swap out the prototype at runtime, so concepts like
                  static dispatching do not exist in JavaScript. While this
                  confusion is often considered to be one of JavaScript's
                  weaknesses, the prototypical inheritance model itself is, in
                  fact, more powerful than the classic model. It is, for
                  example, fairly trivial to build a classic model on top of a
                  prototypical model â€” which is how classes are implemented.
                  Although classes are now widely adopted and have become a new
                  paradigm in JavaScript, classes do not bring a new inheritance
                  pattern. While classes abstract most of the prototypical
                  mechanism away, understanding how prototypes work under the
                  hood is still useful. <br /><br />
                  <strong>Inheritance with the prototype chain</strong><br />
                  <br />Inheriting properties JavaScript objects are dynamic
                  "bags" of properties (referred to as own properties).
                  JavaScript objects have a link to a prototype object. When
                  trying to access a property of an object, the property will
                  not only be sought on the object but on the prototype of the
                  object, the prototype of the prototype, and so on until either
                  a property with a matching name is found or the end of the
                  prototype chain is reached.<br /><br />

                  Note: Following the ECMAScript standard, the notation
                  someObject.[[Prototype]] is used to designate the prototype of
                  someObject. The [[Prototype]] internal slot can be accessed
                  with the Object.getPrototypeOf() and Object.setPrototypeOf()
                  functions. This is equivalent to the JavaScript accessor
                  __proto__ which is non-standard but de-facto implemented by
                  many JavaScript engines. To prevent confusion while keeping it
                  succinct, in our notation we will avoid using obj.__proto__
                  but use obj.[[Prototype]] instead. This corresponds to
                  Object.getPrototypeOf(obj). It should not be confused with the
                  func.prototype property of functions, which instead specifies
                  the [[Prototype]] to be assigned to all instances of objects
                  created by the given function when used as a constructor. We
                  will discuss the prototype property of constructor functions
                  in a later section.
